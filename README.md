# DSnA

This is the final project for Data Structures and Algorithms
Contributers: Riley, Ege, Dominic, CJ

Packages used: NUnit, BenchmarkDotNet

We chose to use Array, Singly Linked List, and Binary Search Tree as our data structures

Our algorithms are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort

We will compare the performance of each algorithm using a randomized selection of each data structure.

We will also put each algorithm to work on a set of real-world data, and analyze their performance.
